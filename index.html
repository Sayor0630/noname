      The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films are a series of American
      superhero films produced by Marvel Studios based on characters that appear
      in publications by Marvel Comics. The MCU is the shared universe in which
      all of the films are set. The films have been in production since 2007,
      and in that time Marvel Studios has produced and released 27 films, with
      at least 12 more in various stages of development. It is the
      highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $24.8
      billion at the global box office. This includes Avengers: Endgame, which
      became the highest-grossing film of all time upon release.
      <br />
      <br />
      Kevin Feige has produced every film in the series, alongside Avi Arad for
      the first two releases, Gale Anne Hurd for The Incredible Hulk, Amy Pascal
      for the Spider-Man films, Stephen Broussard for Ant-Man and the Wasp,
      Jonathan Schwartz for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Nate
      Moore for Eternals, and Brad Winderbaum for Thor: Love and Thunder. The
      films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature
      large, often ensemble, casts. Many of the actors, including Robert Downey
      Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and
      Jeremy Renner signed contracts to star in numerous films.

      Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called "Phases".[1][2] Its
      first film is Iron Man (2008), which was distributed by Paramount
      Pictures. Paramount also distributed Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), and
      Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), while Universal Pictures
      distributed The Incredible Hulk (2008). Walt Disney Studios Motion
      Pictures began distributing the series with the crossover film The
      Avengers (2012), which concluded Phase One. Phase Two comprises Iron Man 3
      (2013), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier
      (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015),
      and Ant-Man (2015).

      Infinity Saga". The Spider-Man films are owned, financed, and distributed
      by Sony Pictures.
